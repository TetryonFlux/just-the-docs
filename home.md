# Pipeline Wiki
{: .fs-9 }

> Information is like light. If it's not captured in some way then it can be lost forever. Retaining artists knowledge as they are onboarded, flow between teams and learn new things can reduce friction as we grow, and improve our ability to keep everyone on the same page.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This knowledgebase was created with the main aim of centralising information relevant to artist production pipelines at `COMPANY NAME`. The centralised, accessible nature of this area means that only a single link has to be shared. By using github pages to host, our team can easily collaborate in maintaining and updating the wiki over time, ensuring any loss of knowledge is kept to a minimum. 

Initially, the focus of the wiki will be to cover the `product creation pipeline`, but if successful, we could roll this out for other pipelines too.

---

## Areas of focus - Product pipeline

* Asset delivery specification (current spec)

* QA specification (& QA checklist) 

* Recommended workflows

* Best practices

* FAQ/Common errors

---

> Complete technical specs on pipelines are stored elsewhere and may only be viewed by internal authorised users. The main aim of this knowledgebase is to serve artists in reducing ambiguity by only showing relevant information.

<!--ORIGINAL TEMPLATE TEXT

# Sunny CADMAN

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
